# Little Space shooter to discover Elm webgl

This repository presents a program written with the [Elm language](https://elm-lang.org) which aims to show that Elm is perfectly adapted for game development.

It uses :
- Elm programming language
- WebGL as rasterization API (for rendering)
- Audio ?
- Tmx loader ?

Very few Elm libraries have been added (except elm-webgl) to show that Elm contains everything that is needed for GD.

## Todo 
- texture region to load spritesheet instead of single sprite
